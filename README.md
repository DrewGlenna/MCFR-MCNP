# MCFR-MCNP
In this work I designed and analyzed the core of a Molten Chloride Fast Reactor in MCNP6. The reactor was designed based off three parametric studies to obtain a critical reactor. The parameteric studies consisted of a fuel composition study, reactor geometry study, and vessel thickness study. Once an optimized critical reactor was designed, the temperature reactivity and reactor shutdown studies were conducted. The temperature reactivity was simulating the keff as the fuel salt increased in temperature. The Boron control rods were designed for a proper reactor shutdown margin. A 1 year BURN study was conducted, which measured neutron kinetics, neutron leakage, average core neutron flux, and the radial neutron flux. The work here was completed during my Neutronics Analysis course. You are free to use the input files as you wish.
